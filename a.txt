This file has the structure for a sample essay.

Introduction:
Here I'm introducing the problems and making the reader aware of the content of the essay.

Body 1:
I start talking about the first advantage of my solution and developing the idea a bit.

Body 2:
I develop the argument a bit more and introduce the 2nd advantage.

Body 3:
I flesh out my solution and give the last advantage.

Counterargument:
I've looked at the alternatives, and here is why my solution is better.

Conclusion:
Finally I'll review the problem, my solution, and why it's a good one.

Aaron peer-reviewed this and it looks like a solid outline.
